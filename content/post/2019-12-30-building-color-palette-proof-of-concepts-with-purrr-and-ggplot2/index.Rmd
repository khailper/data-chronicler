Recently, I raised the idea at work of changing the color palettes we use for 
our dashboards. I felt the default ones we using suffered from not being 
accessible to clients with coor blindness and could also benifit from being more
distinctive. My boss was open to the idea, but (understandably) wanted me to put 
together mockups of possible new palettes before we starting tinkering with our
product. Fortunately the tidyverse makes it fast to generate proof of concepts 
for several palettes.
