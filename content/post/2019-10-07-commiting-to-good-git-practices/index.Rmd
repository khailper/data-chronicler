- intro: good git instructions feel very "draw the owl". Lots of useful 
techniques but little on how to be someone who applies them regularly enough to 
be useful.
- reference old bad git habits
- use iphone reminder
-writing better commit messages by remembering that why doesn't have to be technical
  +if technical, be specific but short (not "fixed bug", but "found difftime issue")
- fork as way to experiment with reports and visuals as well as SW
- acknowledge that you're still exploring a lot of these ideas
