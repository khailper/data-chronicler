One of the skills I have kept struggling the most to cultivate as a data analyst 
is version control. Thanks to the contributions of community members like 
[Jenny Bryan](https://happygitwithr.com/), I know how to commit, branch, merge, 
and submit pull requests and why these skills help my workflow. I know that I 
should commit regularly and that commit messages should describe why I made the 
changes instead of just saying what changed

What I keep having trouble with is how to become the kind of person who does those
things instead of being someone who commits so rarely their messages are 
"finished Script A, wrote Script B, got a good start on Script C". Most of the 
Git resources are more helpful at developing technical skills rather than good
version control habits. This isn't to bash those guides; there's nothing wrong
with having a relatively narrow goal that you do well. 

Also, habits are more personal. The things that have helped me use Git better 
may be useless for you. That said, I wish younger me had something to use as a 
starting point. This is my attempt to write the advice I would have found 
helpful. Hopefully, some of you find it helpful too.

# The key to committing more often is to commit more often 

The first problem I needed to address was that I just wasn't committing often 
enough. It's hard to actually take advantage of Git if going back even one 
commit changes so much that you feel better off just hitting Ctrl-Z a bunch. 
You can't write good messages when a dozen unrelated things have changed.

Fortunately, this had also been the easiest thing to change for me. I often 
went days without committing, so I felt that even shifting to one commit per 
day would be an improvement. I added a reminder for 4pm every workday that just 
said "git commit." 4 was late enough that I would be committing nearly all my 
work the same day I did it but early enough that I didn't feel rushed if I had
a lot I needed to do before leaving.

- use iphone reminder
-writing better commit messages by remembering that why doesn't have to be technical
  +if technical, be specific but short (not "fixed bug", but "found difftime issue")
- fork as way to experiment with reports and visuals as well as SW
- acknowledge that you're still exploring a lot of these ideas
