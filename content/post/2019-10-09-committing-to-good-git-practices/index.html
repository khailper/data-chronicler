<p>One of the skills I keep struggling to cultivate as a data analyst is version
control. Thanks to the work of community members like
<a href="https://happygitwithr.com/">Jenny Bryan</a>, I know how to commit, branch, merge,
and submit pull requests and why these skills are useful. I know that I
should commit regularly and that commit messages should describe why I made the
changes instead of what changed.</p>
<p>What I keep having trouble with is how to be the kind of person who does those
things instead of someone who commits so rarely their messages are
“finished Script A, wrote Script B, got a good start on Script C”. Most of the
Git resources are more helpful at developing technical skills instead of good
habits. This isn’t to bash those guides; it’s often good to have a
relatively narrow goal that you do well.</p>
<p>Also, habits are more personal. The tools that have helped me use Git better
may be useless for you. That said, I wish younger me had something to use as a
starting point. This is my attempt to write the advice I would have found
helpful. Hopefully, some of you find it helpful too.</p>

<h1>The key to committing more often is to commit more often</h1>
<p>The first problem I needed to address was that I just wasn’t committing often
enough. When going back one commit leads to lots of unwanted changes, you feel
better off just hitting Ctrl-Z a bunch. You can’t write good messages when a
dozen unrelated things have changed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this has also been the easiest thing to change for me. I often
went days without committing, so I felt that even shifting to one commit a
day would be an improvement. I added a reminder for 4pm every workday that just
said “git commit”. That was late enough that I would be committing nearly all my
code the same day it was written. At the same time, it was early enough that I
didn’t feel rushed if I had a lot I needed to do before leaving.</p>
<p>My plan was to stick to one commit a day until I felt like had built the habit,
then add a second reminder earlier in the day. Eventually, I’d have enough
reminders that my commits would usually be a reasonable size. Fortunately, I
didn’t need to have my phone beep at me five times a day. Making commits a daily
habit made me more mindful of the fact that I hadn’t done a commit even when it
was nowhere near 4 o’clock. Before long, I was doing multiple commits most days.</p>

<div id="explaining-why-for-broad-definitions-of-why" class="section level1">
<h1>Explaining why (for broad definitions of “why”)</h1>
<p>I used to write messages like “fixed score calculation” and “updated color
palette”. Neither of these are ideal commit messages as they just say things
that are probably obvious from a quick glance at the diff. The problem was I
didn’t have anything that felt like a “proper” commit message, like “old score
system lead to dividing by strings”. The problem wasn’t the code per se, just
that it didn’t serve the business needs.</p>
<p>The epiphany came when I realized that “didn’t serve the business needs” was a
perfectly good “why” all by itself, as long as I was clear what those
shortcomings were. Now I’m often writing commit messages like “SME pointed out
error in the score calculation” and “old color palette was garish”.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this is very much a work in progress. While I know how to write
better commit messages, I still haven’t fully internalized that idea. I
still periodically write messages that are too focused on the what or vague as
to the why. In addition, I’ve got a while to go before I feel like I have a good
sense of what a commit message for a blog post should look like.</p>

<h1>Going out on a limb</h1>
<p>Even more so than commit messages, my experience with using branches is limited.
This is mostly me theorizing about what would be a good way to uses branches
more effectively. If you have experience in an analytics context (data viz,
reports, etc.), please feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/khailper">let me know</a>.
I’d love to share other people’s solutions to this problem.</p>
<p>Looking back at some of my work, I think I should have treated branches like
a scratch pad. There have been times when I’ve experimented with a novel
graph type or tried to look at the data from another angle, only to create
something that was confusing or produced no new insights. Since I often rewrote
larges chunks of the report around these ideas, having to roll back all the
changes was a regular source of frustration. If I had put those changes in a
branch, a lot of hassle could have been avoided.</p>
<p>In hindsight, this isn’t all that different from one of the main way branches
are used in software development: testing out new features in controlled manner
and only integrating them once you’re confident they won’t break anything. The
editing process and running visuals by third parties for feedback isn’t all that
different than making sure your new code passes unit tests.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I still feel like I have a ways to go before I feel comfortable like an expert
in Git, but it’s hard not to look back and think “Wow, I was so much worse at
this back then” (but in a good way). I’m looking forward to the day when I look
at my current practices with as much horror as I currently do with younger me.</p>
